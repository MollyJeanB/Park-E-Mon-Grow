## HIGH LEVEL GOAL

* Get people outside and engaged with public spaces. 
* Increase their awareness of micro-climates throughout the city and even encourage tending or “Guerilla gardening” in neglected public spaces.
* Raise money for environmental non-profits, from both corporate sponsors and individuals

## HOW IT WORKS

 A team of volunteers places the pins in parks, community gardens, and public spaces that could use some love. Three local environmental non-profits become the “teams” for the app. Ideally, there will be a funding sponsor that will donate money that one of the teams will win. Individual players are also encouraged to make micro-contributions that the sponsor will additionally match.

Each pin has a temperature and humidity sensor, as well as a button that triggers an LED screen.

When players sign up for the app, they join one of the non-profit’s teams. They can view a map which displays the locations of all the pins, as well as the current temperature and humidity at the pin site. They can also see which team is currently in possession of the park--that is, whichever team had the most recent visitor.

In order to get points, the players must go to the pin site. When they get close to pin, they will trip the motion sensor, and the LED display will show the pin’s secret code. The player enters the code in the app, and wins points for their team. They win a set amount of points for visiting the park, and additional points if they “take” the park from another team.

At the end of the month, the sponsor makes a contribution to the non-profit whose team has the most points.

Players will become more invested and engaged in public spaces near them. In the cases of communally maintained spaces, the pins will additionally make people aware of when places might need attention and watering.
